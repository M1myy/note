### heuristics

heuristics are problem-dependent techniques:

* They usually are adapted to the problem at hand.
* They try to take full advantage of the particularities of this problem.
* However, because they are often too greedy, they usually get trapped in a local optimum and thus fail, in general, to obtain the global optimum solution. 

### Meta-heuristics

Meta-heuristics are problem-independent techniques:

* They do not take advantage of any specificity of the problem, therefore, they can be used as black boxes.  
* In general, they are not greedy.  
* In fact, they may even accept a temporary deterioration of the solution (see for example, the simulated-annealing technique), which allows them to explore more thoroughly the solution space and thus to get a hopefully better solution (that sometimes will coincide with the global optimum).  
* Please note that although a meta-heuristic is a problem-independent technique, it is nonetheless necessary to do some fine-tuning of its intrinsic parameters in order to adapt the technique to the problem at hand. 

### hyper-heuristics

You might want to take a look also at the so-called hyper-heuristics that go a step beyond meta-heuristics.  The particularity of hyper-heuristics is that their search space is not the usual space of the solutions but is rather the space of heuristics or meta-heuristics.  Indeed, hyper-heuristics can be viewed as "heuristics to search for heuristics". There is also a slightly different category defined as "heuristics to generate heuristics". (see links)
