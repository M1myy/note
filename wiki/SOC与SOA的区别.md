**Essential difference**

* SOC is a paradigm
* SOA is an architecture

**Paradigm & Architecture**

Paradigm: a framework containing the basic assumptions, ways of thinking, and methodology that are commonly accepted by members of a scientific community.

Architecture: is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing physical or software structures.

**SOC & SOA**

As a paradigm, SOC is a concept that assembles software applications to create a network of services in order to achieve rapid, low-cost, and cross-organizational distributed business process, whereas the role of SOA is to provide a suitable design to achieve this vision, i.e., it depicts how software applications should be written in order to satisfy SOC's goal.
