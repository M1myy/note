The rapidly development on mobile devices and mobile communication leads to the prosperity of mobile service computing, and their optimal service composition is often diffcult to address because of the mobility of mobile devices. How to design a composition model and corresponding schedule algorithm has become one of the main foci of mobile practitioners.

A careful investigation into existing methods has found their various limitations, especially the assumption of time-invariant availability of mobile services. In this paper, we introduce a reliability-aware and deadline-constrain service composition method for optimal schedule over mobile opportunistic network. Instead of considering time-invariant availability of mobile node, our proposed method captures the fluctuation of mobile service and evaluates the reliability of a schedule. Then a Krill-Herd-Based algorithm is employed to yields reliability-optimal schedules to improve the success rate while meeting the constraints of deadline.

Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via case study. The proposed method can aid the design and optimization of mobile service composition over dynamic mobile network and help practitioners understand reliability aspects of mobile service composition.
