In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework for optimal mobile service compositing on mobile environment. We present a mobile service opportunistic network model(MSON) that fully integrates human mobility behavior factors for mobile service provisioning. Then we formulate the mobile service composition over MSON problem as an optimal problem to maximize the quality of service composition (i.e., combine QoS), propose an improved Krill-herd(IKH) algorithm to solve it, and a case study based on real-world opportunistic network and some well-known web service dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms current standard composition methods in mobile environments.

We plan to consider the following topics for future work: 1) Some prediction methods (e.g., hidden Markov model and neural networks) can be used to predict user future's movement to formulate a better mobile model; 2) more QoS metrics, e.g., service price and service reputation are supposed to be analyzed and blends into our QoS model; 3) this work doesn't consider Service-Level-Agreement(SLA) constrains. We intend to consider SLA constraints and introduce corresponding algorithms to generate run-time composition.
