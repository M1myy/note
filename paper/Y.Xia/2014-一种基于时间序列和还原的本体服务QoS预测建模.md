### Abstract

In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework to preÂ­dict the runtime QoS of OWL-S ontologoies by employing an Autoregressive-Moving-Avege Model and QoS reduction rules.

In the case study of a real-world ontology sample, a comparison between existing approaches and the proposed one is presented and results suggest that the proposed one achieves higher prediction accuacy.
