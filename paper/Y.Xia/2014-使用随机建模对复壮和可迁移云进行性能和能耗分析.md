### Abstract

In the cloud computing paradigm, periodical（周期性的） rejuvenation serves as a preventive（预防性的） measure consolidates（巩固） robustness and performance through refreshing cloud data-centers or machines. 

Another factor that influences system performance is VM migration, which transports VMs from a physical machine to another. In this work, we propose a comprehensive（综合的） framework to model and evaluate performance and energy consumption of cloud-based systems with rejuvenation, migration, failure, and repair. 

The accuracy and correctness of the proposed model and analysis method are validated by discrete-event（离散时间） simulation.
