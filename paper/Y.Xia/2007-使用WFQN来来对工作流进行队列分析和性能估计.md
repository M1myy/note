### Abstract

Performance prediction is one of the most important research topics of workflow. To investigate（调查） the performance of workflow systems in queuing condition, this paper extends traditional WF-net into WFQN (WF queuing network), by modeling tasks as FIFS (first-in-first-service) queues and the source place as the input of tokens following poisson arrival（泊松到达） process. 

Analytical methods are introduced to evaluate the queue-length, wait-time and completion-duration. The case study (especially the case of airline ticket booking application) shows that WFQN can model real-world workflow-based applications effectively. 

Through Montecarlo simulations in the case study, we show analytical models are verified by simulative results. We also present a sensitivity（灵敏度） analysis technique to identify performance bottle-necks（瓶颈） of WFQN. This paper concludes with a comparison with relate work.
