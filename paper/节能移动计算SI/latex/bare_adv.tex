% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

\IEEEPARstart{I}{n recent} years, service-oriented computing has become an increasingly important computing paradigm to develop
and integrate distributed enterprise information systems [T]. With the rapid developments in mobile devices and wireless technologies, Web services are no longer limited to traditional platforms and they are becoming more flexible and com- plex. The manufacturers of mobile devices have also recently achieved breakthroughs to extend mobile devices’ capabilities in terms of memory, computational power, storage capacity, and display screens as well as expand their capabilities and functionalities with other integrated devices, such as built-in cameras, infrared ports, and Bluetooth technology [T]. As aresult, theglobal interestof mobileapplications isonthe rise. Both researchers and industrial companies are inspired to pave the road for mobile Web service provisioning [T][2].

Opportunistic computing provides an appealing alternative to the mobile computing cloud by allowing devices to join forces and leverage heterogeneous resources from other devices[1 abstract].

To complement online mobile crowdsourcing services, in this paper we advocate Crowd Foraging,a QoS-oriented selforganized mobile crowdsourcing framework, where a mobile user can self-organize her task crowdsourcing in a proactive manner by leveraging a massive crowd of opportunistically encountered mobile human workers in realtime. Its main rationality is four-fold. First, opportunistic user encounters are prevalent and sufficient in daily life [T], which offers plenty of opportunities to exploit nearby human intelli- gence for task solving [T], [T], [T]. Second, many mobile crowdsourcing tasks require local knowledge and information (e.g., location-based content sensing [T], [T], [T] and content transmission [T]–[T]), and hence nearby human workers are more adept at executing them than the online workers. Third, D2D communications such as Bluetooth, WiFi-direct and LTE-D2D are promising to replenish traditional cellular communications in terms of user throughput increase, cellular traffic reduction and network coverage extension [T]. At last, this framework shares the similar spirit with the emerging paradigm “cyber foraging” over opportunistic networks, such that mobile users opportunistically exploit nearby device resources to facilitate their computational task processing [T][3].

Because the pervasive vision revolves around the human user, it can only be achieved by a flexible networking paradigm that adapts to the user instead of expecting the user to adapt. Human users move around freely and cannot be expected to always be within range of an access point or a mesh router. On the other hand, humans are social by nature, and they can very well be expected to come in contact with each other with a relatively high frequency; it is this very expectation that constitutes the basic tenet of opportunistic networking [1].

\subsection{Mobile Web Service}
Mobile Web services are deployed on mobile devices and
provisioned over wireless networks, and devices may play the roles of consumers, brokers, or providers. Their role as aWeb service requester isfundamental. Shifting such a role from a requester to a provider, however, is feasible only if mobile devices can offer standard Web services with accept- able performance while making negligible impact on their regular usage. The concept of mobile Web services was first introduced as a computing paradigm in the early twenty-first century [T]. It brought many challenges to traditional ser- vice computing techniques mainly due to their technological limitations, summarized as follows.


\emph{1) Mobility:} Mobile devices frequently change network operators and may handover between different technologies within the same network. Also, because they are expected to experience frequent link failures, services they provide may become temporarily unreachable. This presents major chal- lenges for providing reliable Web services in highly dynamic mobile wireless environments. 

\emph{2) Limited Resources:} Although the capabilities of mobile devices have improved in terms of processing power, mem- ory space, and embedded sensors, they continue to lag behind other forms of computing devices. Mobile devices (smartphones in particular) are still recognized as resource- constrained computing devices [T]. Battery power is the number one limited resource in mobile phones, which remains a major challenge for potential growth of mobile computing [T]. Recent developments in mobile computing and growing popularity of mobile applications outpace what current battery technologies can provide.

\emph{3) Addressability:} 

\emph{4) Scalability:} 

Due to the above characteristics, the existing service com-
puting protocols and mechanisms can be hardly utilized for mobile Web services. Therefore, it is essential to study new protocols and mechanisms that are more suitable for mobile domains. In this paper, we mainly target at the service selection by considering user mobility [2].


\subsection{Motivation Scenario}

\subsection{Contributions}
To address the aforementioned challenges and concerns,
we propose a new approach for service selections and com- positions in mobile environments. The main contributions are:

1) We propose an architecture for mobile service provision [mobile service sharing community (MSSC)] to address the problem of service selection for mobile service com- position in the mobile community where both service requesters and providers are nonstationary. In such com- munity, mobile users can share mobile services through their mobile devices in specific areas.

2) For MSSC, we propose a mobility model to describe mobile user moving behavior. The model is extended from the random waypoint (RWP) model.

3) Based on MSSC and the proposed mobility model, we transfer the mobility-aware service composition prob- lem to an optimization problem and propose to utilize the Krill-Herd (KH) algorithm to solve it. We conduct aseries of evaluations to validate that our algorithmis approximately optimal and performs much better than other standard composition approaches. We compare it with other population-based optimization methods for both optimality and scalability.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II reviews the related work. Section III introduces the MSSC architecture. Section IV describes our approach to make service compositions. Section V presents experimental results. Section VI concludes this paper.

\section{MOBILE OPPORTUNISTIC NETWORK}
In opportunistic networks [T], node-to-node communication occurs by exploiting any tidbit of connectivity that becomes available. Nodes in an opportunistic network rely on pairwise encounters and a store-and-forward paradigm to send information to each other over multiple hops even in the absence of an end-to-end path. Opportunistic communication is possible as long as there are foris no longer viewed as a disruptive phenomenon that thwarts the laborious routing process, but as a benefit that streamlines communication by offering new data exchange opportunities between nodes. Mobility enables nodes to come in contact with other nodes and makes it more likely for them to encounter useful forwarders that can get their messages closer to its intended destination.
Thewarding opportunities. By breaking away from any end-to-end path requirement, opportunistic networks lend themselves to the pervasive vision by making connectivity available anywhere and anytime, though not all the time. Any user can exchange data with any other user from any location at any time, as long as she is not a hermit and is in no hurry. Opportunistic networks allow information to flow to its destination through the combined use of network connectivity and node mobility. Mobility is no longer viewed as a disruptive phenomenon that thwarts the laborious routing process, but as a benefit that streamlines communication by offering new data exchange opportunities between nodes. Mobility enables nodes to come in contact with other nodes and makes it more likely for them to encounter useful forwarders that can get their messages closer to its intended destination [1].
Fig. 1 illustrates the working procedure of the Crowd Foraging framework. In an opportunistic network scenario, amobile task requester R launches a mobile crowdsourcing task. She moves around in the network and opportunistically encounters a mobile human worker W1.After probing the work ability of the worker W1 via D2D link, if the task requester R decides to recruit the worker in terms of a specific recruitment policy, she will forward the detailed contents of the task (e.g., images, videos and text descriptions) to the recruited worker via D2D link. Once the worker finishes the task, he will send the results to the task requester via either cellular link directly or D2D link when they encounter with each other again before a given deadline. Finally, the task requester receiving the results will grant the task reward to the worker. We should emphasize that, our framework only considers one-hop mechanism for both worker recruitment and result collection, since realistic dataset analyses reveal that users’ one-hop neighbors are sufficient [7] and can cover most range of the whole network in a reasonable time period [10], and contacting a user would incur long delay if the maximum D2D communication hops are larger than two [15]. Compared with multi-hop mechanisms in existing researches [1], [3], [4], [6], [11], [12], this one-hop feature can lower the network overhead (e.g., no need to transfer a large volume of task contents hop by hop) and ensure framework performance with only local information, which ismore practical in real life[3].

In this section, we introduce MSSC that is a virtual community formed by multiple mobile users. Within it, users can share services on their own mobile devices through mobile networks. It has three main characteristics as follows.

1) Locality: An MSSC is not established on the Internet. It corresponds to a specific region such as a univer- sity campus, a company building, and a restaurant. Only mobile users who enter the same region can share services with each other.

2) Dynamicity: MSSC participants are not stationary. They can enter or leave the community at any time.

3) Mobility: Services provided by mobile users are not fixed at the same location. Service requesters are also mobile when invoking a mobile service.

In order to provide more details for MSSC, this section gives its basic architecture, operations, and applications.

\section{SERVICE COMPOSITION OVER MON APPROACH}
\subsection{Node Availiable for Opportunistic network}
In wireless mobile networks such as ad hoc or mesh networks, the availability of a node to its neighbour nodes is highly related to the node’s mobility—here it is assumed that battery power is not a concern and as such a node will not out of reach because of battery exhaustion. If node i moves outside the transmission range of its neighbouring node j, then node i is unreachable by node j and as a result the services on node i become unavailable to node j either. Node availability, to some extent, also expresses network availability because if the connection between any two neighbouring nodes in a route from a service provider to a service requester becomes unavailable, then the whole route also becomes unavailable. Here node mobility is utilized to calculate the node availability [4].

Consider, as illustrated in Fig. 2, two mobile hosts MHi
and MHj of the same transmission range R. Each node moves randomly and it is assumed that the moving field is a circle with a radius of r. d represents the distance between MHi and MHj. These three parameters are to be used for calculating the node availability. The transmis- sion range of a node R is known (e.g., pre-defined or changing according to certain algorithm). Suppose the location (i.e., coordinates) of each mobile host is known (e.g., via GPS—global positioning system), then distance d can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, i.e.,$\sqrt{{(x_i-x_j)^2}+{y_i-y_j}^2}$ where $(x_i, x_j)$ and $(y_i, y_j)$ are are the coordinates of MHi and MHj respectively. Finally let us discuss how to calculate r.

The moving radius of a mobile host (r) is its speed (s) multiplied by the average service time (t). Here t can be statistically calculated as the average value of last n servings of this component service, namely, $t = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}t_i/n$. The speed of a mobile host s can be calculated based on its moving distance during a period from t1 to t2 [18], namely: $s = \sqrt{{(x_i-x_j)^2}+{y_i-y_j}^2}/(t_2-t_1)$. Then $r = s \times t$.

Knowing the values of these three parameters R, r,
and d, the probability of MHi staying inside the transmission range of MHj (denoted as $P_i^{IN}$ ) can be calculated by

\begin{equation}
P_i^{IN} = \frac{A_i^{IN}}{A_i^T}
\end{equation}

Namely, $P^{IN}_i$ equals to the area of the MHi’smoving field inside the transmission range of MHj (denoted as $A^{IN}_i$) divided by the overall area of the MHi’s moving field($A^T_i$).

As shown in Fig. 2, we have

\begin{equation}
\alpha = arcons(\frac{r^2+d^2-R^2}{2r\times d})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta = arcons(\frac{R^2+d^2-r^2}{2r\times d})
\end{equation}

Then, 

\begin{equation}
A^{IN}_i = [(\frac{2\beta}{2\pi}\pi R^2)-(\frac{R sin\beta cos\beta}{2}2)] \\
 + [(\frac{2\alpha}{2\pi}\pi r^2)-(\frac{r sin\alpha cos\alpha}{2}2)] \\
= \beta R^2 + \alpha r^2 - (R^2 sin\beta cos\beta + r^2 sin\alpha cos\alpha)
\end{equation}

There is also
\begin{equation}
A_i^T = \pi r^2 = \pi \times (s \times t)^2
\end{equation}
