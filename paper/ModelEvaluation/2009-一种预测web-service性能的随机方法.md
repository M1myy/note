### Abstract

In this paper, we propose an analytical approach（分析方法） to predict the performance of web service composition built on BPEL. 

The approach first translates web service composition specification into Stochastic Petri Nets. From the SPN model and its corresponding continuous-time Markov chain, we derive the analytical performance estimates（估计） of process-completion-time. 

In the case study, we also use computer simulation techniques to validate our analytical model. The paper concludes with a comparison with related work.
