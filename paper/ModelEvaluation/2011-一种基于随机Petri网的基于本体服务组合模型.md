### Abstract

OWL-S, one of the most significant Semantic web service ontologies proposed to date, provides Web Service providers with a core ontological framework and guidelines for describing the properties and capabilities of their web Services in unambiguous, computer interpretable form（可解释的形式）. 

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for OWL-S processes, employing the Non-markovian stochastic Petri net (NMSPN) as the intermediate representation（中间表示）. A set of translation rules is defined for constructs and activities（结构和活动） of OWL-S so that processes specified in OWL-S can be translated into NMSPN. Based on the NMSPN representation, analytical methods for QoS analysis can be designed.
