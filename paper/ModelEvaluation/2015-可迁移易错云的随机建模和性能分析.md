### Abstract

Performance evaluation of clouds is required to evaluate（评估） and quantify（量化） the cost-benefit of a strategy portfolio（投资组合） and the quality of service (QoS) experienced by end-users.

Such evaluation is not feasible（可行的） by means of simulation or on-the-fieldmeasurement, due to the great scale of parameter spaces that have to be traversed（获得）. 

In this study, we present a stochastic-queuing-network-based approach to performance analysis of migration-enabled clouds in error-prone environment. 

Several performance metrics are defined and evaluated: utilization（利用率）, expected task completion time, and task rejection rate under different load con-ditions and error intensities. 

To validate the proposed approach,we obtain experimental performance data through a real-world cloud and conduct a confidence-interval（置信区间） analysis. The analysis results suggest the perfect coverage of theoretical performance results by corresponding（对应） experimental confidence intervals.
