### Abstract

With the increasing call for green cloud, reducing energy consumption has been an important requirement for cloud resource providers not only to reduce operating costs, but also to improve system reliability. 

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS: 动态电压缩放) has been a key technique in exploiting（利用） the hardware characteristics of cloud datacenters to save energy by lowering the supply voltage and operating frequency（工作频率）. 

This paper presents a novel（新奇的） stochastic framework for energy efficiency and performance analysis of DVS-enabled cloud. This framework uses virtual machine request arrival rate, failure rate, repair rate, and service rate of datacenter servers as model inputs. Based on a queuing-network-based analysis, this paper gives analytic solutions of three metrics. The proposed framework can be used to help the design and optimization of energy-aware high performance cloud systems.
