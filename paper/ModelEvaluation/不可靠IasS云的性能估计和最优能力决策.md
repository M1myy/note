### Abstract

Through Internet, a cloud computing system provides shared resources, data, and information to users or tenant users in an on-demand and pay-as-you-go styles. It delivers large scale utility computing services to a wide range of consumers.
To ensure that their provisioned service is acceptable, cloud providers must exploit（开发；开拓） techniques and mechanisms that meet the Service-Level-Agreement (SLA) performance commitment to their clients. Thus, performance issues of cloud infrastructures have been receiving considerable attention by both researchers and practitioners as a prominent（突出的） activity for improving service quality. 

This paper presents an analytical approach to percentile based performance analysis of unreliable Infrastructure-as-a- Service clouds. The performance measured in a certain level percentile of the request response time evaluated under variable load intensities, fault frequencies, multiplexing abilities, and instantiation processing times. 

A case study based on a real-world cloud is carried out to prove the correctness of the proposed theoretical model. To achieve optimal performance-cost tradeoff（权衡；折衷）, we formulate the performance model into an optimal capacity decision problem for cost minimization subjected to（遭受到） the constraints of request rejection and SLA violation（违反） rates. We show that the optimization problem can be numerically solved through a simulated-annealing（模拟退火） method.
