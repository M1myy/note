### Abstract

Cloud computing is a recently developed new technology for complex systems with massive service sharing, which is different from the resource sharing of the grid computing systems. In a cloud environment, service requests from users go through numerous provider specific steps from the instant it is submitted to when the service is fully delivered. 

Quality modeling and analysis of clouds are not easy tasks because of the complexity of the provisioning mechanism and the dynamic cloud environment. 

This study proposes（提出） an analytical model-based approach for quality evaluation（评估） of Infrastructure-as-a- Service cloud and consider expected request completion time, rejection probability, and system overhead rate as key QoS metrics. It also features with the modeling of different warming and cooling strategies of machines and the ability to identify the optimal balance between system overhead and performance.
